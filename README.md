# eo_data

August 2024 - 

July 2023 - new GFN data retrieved by API as JSON files and imported into CSV

December 2022 - added newest WB Pop & Pop growth = 2021
but GFN had nothing more recent and that was 2018
wondered whether teryy wants to keep close to GFN date (for valid comparison)
or under each heading to have most recent available.
